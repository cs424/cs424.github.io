**1.** This task continues the work from Task 2.
Modify the layout file `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`
and the stylesheet `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`
to add some decoration to all of your pages.

**2.**
Either generate a new action
(i.e. a controller method and a view page) for
your application or pick an existing action
whose view page you want to look particularly
nice.  Then use a suitable stylesheet to
make this page look special.

**3.** Push your application to a dedicated repository
on `github`.

**4.** Prepare a one page report on your progress
and hand it up in class next Wednesday.
Use the comment box below to attract attention
in case you get stuck.
