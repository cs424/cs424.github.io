Put your answers to the following three questions into the comment box below.

**1.** What sort of application would you like to develop?
For starters, give it a *name* and briefly sketch one or two 
typical *use cases*.  Which rails command would set up
the files for a new application with this name?

**2.** What is the first table, that your application would need (like
the `products` table in the `depot` application)?  Decide on a
descriptive *name*, and list the *components* (and their *types*) of
an object to be stored in the table.  (You can change all of this
later if you think you have to.)

**3.** Formulate the `rails` scaffolding commands that would create such
a table with the desired components.
