Welcome to the CS424 blog.  Here you will find some course related
material, that will be published over time. 

First and foremost, this site will be the source of instructions
for our weekly practicals.

Every so often, additional material might become available,
if you wish you can write pages yourself and have them published here.

Feel free to make extensive use of the comment facilies at the bottom
of each page.

*Rails on Ubuntu*

Here, we will use Rails version 4.1.6 (and ruby version at least 1.9).  
To install this on a PC under a recent Ubuntu distribution:
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3
sudo gem install rails -v 4.1.6
{% endhighlight %}
On a freshly installed ubuntu, a couple of additional packages are needed:
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev libsqlite3-dev nodejs git
{% endhighlight %}
