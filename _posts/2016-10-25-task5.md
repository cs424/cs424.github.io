**1.** This will be short, after all there's a bank holiday weekend coming up.

**2.** Identify an aspect of your application that you are currently
not particularly happy with.

**3.** Click on the `Issues` link on your `github` project page,
and formulate the issue you have with your application.
Provide enough details so that a casual visitor of this page
would be in a position to provide a solution, provided they have one.
