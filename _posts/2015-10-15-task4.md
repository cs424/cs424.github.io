**1.** This task continues the work from Task 3. 
Based on a use case or two, sketch a page flow that you
would like to implement.

**2.** What is the other important type of data you want to support?
Add a second table to your application to represent these data.
Describe the relationship between the two tables and implement the
corresponding two way links in your models, if necessary with the help
of a third table.

**3.** Push your modifications to `github`.
Invite user `cs424` to be a collaborator on this
project.

**4.** Edit the `README.md` file so that it gives
a brief description of your application
(instead of the standard README).
This file is written in a markup language called *markdown*.
That's the language which is also used for these blog pages.
A (brief) description of its syntax can be found on the
[kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) homepage.
