**1.** This task continues the work begun in Task 1.  In your first
table, what restrictions need to be put on the various attributes of
the data objects?  Formulate at least two such constraints as
validators.  You might want to consult the documentation at
<http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html> to see
what types of validations are available.

**2.** Make sure the automatically generated tests still succeed.
If necessary, modify the (automatially generated) fixtures
and test routines to take into account the contstraints you put in place in
part 1.

**3.** Formulate one test that checks whether validation works as intended.

**4.** Prepare a (less than one page) report on your progress
and hand it up in class next Wednesday.
